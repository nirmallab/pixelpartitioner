Briefly, the function takes in the single-cell table (`spatialTablePath`) with X and Y coordinates, the full image (`imagePath`) and lastly a list of `markers` for which thumbnails need to be generated. Please note as the program does not know which channels in the image corresponds to the `markers`, hence, the `markerChannelMapPath` is used to supply a `.csv` file that maps the channels to the marker information. The `markerChannelMap` follow 1-indexing convention- so the first channel is represented by the number `1`. \n",

This basically means that even if more than 100 cells are identified, only 100 random cells will be used to generate the thumbnails. I generally generate a minimum of `2000` cells. As this is for illustration purpose only, I have set it to `100`. \n",

If there are any truly negative thumbnails in the `TruePos` folder, move it to `PosToNeg` folder. Similarly, if there are any truly positive thumbnails in `TrueNeg` folder, move it to `NegToPos` folder. You will often notice that imaging artifacts are captured in the `TruePos` folder and there will also likely be a number of true positives in the `TrueNeg` folder as the field of view (64x64) is larger than what the program used to identify those thumbnails (just the centroids of single cells at the center of that thumbnail).  \n",

The difference being that each thumbnail is normalized to the maximum intensity pixel in that thumbnail. It helps to visually sort out the true positives and negatives faster and more reliably. As we will not use the thumbnails in the `localNorm` for training the deep learning model, we want to make sure all the manual sorting that we did in the `localNorm` folder is copied over to the real training data.
