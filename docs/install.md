# üêä Getting Started with Pixel Partitioner 
  
Before we set up Pixel Partitioner, we highly recommend using a environment manager like Conda. Using an environment manager like Conda allows you to create and manage isolated environments with specific package versions and dependencies. 
  
**Download and Install the right [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) based on the opertating system that you are using**

## **Create a new conda environment**

```
# use the terminal (mac/linux) and anaconda promt (windows) to run the following command

conda create --name pixelpartitioner -y python=3.11
conda activate pixelpartitioner
```

**Install `pixelpartitioner` within the conda environment.**

```
pip install pixelpartitioner
```

#### Use IDE or Jupyter notebook to run the package

```python
pip install notebook

# open the notebook and import pixelpartitioner
import pixelpartitioner as pp

# Go to the tutorial section to follow along
```
